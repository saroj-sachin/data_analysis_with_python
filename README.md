# Python for Data Analysis – Practice Repository

This repository contains my practice work from “Python for Data Analysis” by Wes McKinney (3rd Edition), implemented in Jupyter Notebooks. It documents my learning journey in Python, pandas, NumPy, and data analysis workflows.

### Contents

- Python basics & functions
- NumPy arrays & operations
- pandas data structures
- Data loading & storage (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- Data cleaning & preparation
- Data wrangling & transformation
- Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

### Tools & Libraries

- **Python 3**
- **pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

### Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Working with structured & unstructured data
- Writing reproducible analysis workflows
- Applying Python for real-world datasets

### Usage

Clone and run notebooks:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saroj-sachin/data_analysis_with_python.git
```

This repo highlights my hands-on practice with core data analysis skills and serves as a foundation for my future projects in analytics and data science.
